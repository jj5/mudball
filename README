= Mudball =

Hi there. This is the Mudball web framework and toolkit by John Elliot V.

One day this will probably be an open-source / free software project but at the moment it is
unlicensed because it is in an experimental state and I am not yet in a position to support
others' use of the code base as it will change rapidly with no backward compatibility.

The project has a home page, here:

= Adding mudball to your project =

cd /path/to/your/project
mkdir ext
git submodule add git@github.com:jj5/mudball.git ext/mudball
git submodule init

git add .gitmodules ext

```
